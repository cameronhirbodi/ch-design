  <p>During my many years at Ford, I have strived on building great experiences for the next generation of Ford & Lincoln in-vehicle displays. This includes features spanning across the center stack and instrument cluster. I am excited to share that my contributions have been revealed with the launch of the 2024 Lincoln Navigator.</p>

  <p>My responsibilities include translating research from vehicle clinics and usability testing into ideal user experiences with HMI specifications, wireframing, and developing functional prototypes. I am working hand-in-hand with developers and product managers to translate complex requirements into elegant and user friendly experiences. This requires advocating for the latest design principles and systems with peers to streamline development efforts while prioritizing customer needs.</p>
