  <p>For some years, I have strived on building great experiences for the next generation of Ford & Lincoln in-vehicle displays. This includes various features spanning across the center stack and instrument cluster. I am excited to share that my contributions have been revealed with the launch of the 2024 Lincoln Navigator.</p>

  <p>My responsibilities included translating findings from vehicle clinics and usability testing into ideal user experiences with HMI specifications, wireframing, and developing functional prototypes.

This requires research and advocating latest design principles and systems with peers to streamline development efforts while prioritizing the customer experience.</p>
