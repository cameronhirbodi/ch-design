  <h5>Objective</h5>
  <p>For some years, I have focused on building great experiences for the next generation of Ford & Lincoln in-vehicle displays. This includes numerous features that span across the center stack and instrument clusters. My most recent involvement has been with the launch of the 2024 Lincoln Nautilus.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Some of my responsibilities include translating findings from vehicle clinics and usability testing into ideal user experiences with specifications, wireframes, hero screens, and functional prototypes. I am working hand-in-hand with developers and stakeholders to translate complex behavior flows into elegant in-vehicle user experiences. This requires research and advocating latest design principles and systems with peers within the organization to streamline development efforts.</p>

  <p>With these vehicles actively in development, I am not permitted to share more. However, I am excited to share more details as they go to production.</p>
