#### My Role

Visual Design, Icon Design, Animation, Prototyping

#### Objective

This exercise consisted of building the fully featured instrument panel for the Honda Sports EV concept since it was never showcased. It was crucial to incorporate Honda's familiar racing DNA while still allowing clear and legible data for the driver. The Honda Sports EV should be fun to drive and the driver should feel one with it.

##### The Approach

As part of research and execution of this project, the following processes were required:

##### Competitive Analysis

Before starting, it helped to study the interfaces from other similarly priced vehicles in the industry. Are there common features that should be considered and/or omitted? Are there examples of sportiness incorporated in said vehicles? Looking back at Honda's own previous sports and electric vehicles, can features be tied in to bring familarity?

Most vehicles had a dedicated instrument panel behind the steering wheel with the exception of the Tesla Model 3 that uses the center dashboard display for everything. The Honda E also uses one long attached display, but a portion behind the steering wheel is used for more crucial data such as a speedometer.

I also felt it would be a nice nod to older Honda sports road and racing cars to take traits from their gauges. This might be more of an aesthetic consideration, but it would bring a sense of continuity.

The challenge would be applying these visual traits to an electric vehicle. Unlike EVs, the referenced sports / racing vehicles required more emphasis on the tachometer as they run on iternal combustion engines. However, the driver no longer needs to focus on shifting gears and managing engine revs as electric vehicles typically have single gears with a flat torque band.

##### Sketches

Taking my research into account, it was time to sketch the features I had in mind into a visual. The elements that seemed critical to start with included current speed, selected gear, remaining charge, critical status indicators and time. 

Other nice to have features to explore were weather, navigation, media, and additional vehicle stats. I just wanted to be very mindful of distracting the driver with too much information, affecting the safety.
