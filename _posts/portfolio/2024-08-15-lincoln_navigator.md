  <p>For some years, I have strived on building great experiences for the next generation of Ford & Lincoln in-vehicle displays. This includes various features spanning across the center stack and instrument clusters. My most recent contribution has been with the launch of the 2025 Lincoln Navigator.</p>

  <p>Some of my responsibilities include translating findings from vehicle clinics and usability testing into ideal user experiences with specifications, wireframes, hero screens, and functional prototypes. I am working hand-in-hand with developers and stakeholders to translate complex behavior flows into elegant in-vehicle user experiences. This requires research and advocating latest design principles and systems with peers within the organization to streamline development efforts.</p>

  <p>One of the features I was involved with was designing the experience for Rejuvenate. This is a stationary experience with several orchestrations occuring in the interior to give the customer a relaxing experience. This includes reclining the seat, massing the occupants, diffusing calming scents in the cabin, and playing their choice of relaxing footage across the 48-inch panoramic display.

  <p>It is important that customers have an interface that provides insight into the timing of the experience, configurations of various orchestrations, and the ability to start / stop whenever they choose. All of this should be in a clear and minimal approach without distracting from being immersed in the experience.</p>
  
  <p>I am excited to share more details as the Navigator soon goes to production.</p>
