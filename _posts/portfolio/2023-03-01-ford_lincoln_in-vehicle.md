  <h5>Objective</h5>
  <p>I am currently working on the next generation of Ford & Lincoln in-vehicle experiences. This includes features that span across the center stack and instrument clusters displays.</p>
  <p>As these vehicles are currently in development, I am not permitted to share more. However, I plan to share more details as they go to production.</p>
