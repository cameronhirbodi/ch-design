#### My Role

Research, Visual Design, Animation, Prototyping

#### Objective

I am currently working on the next generation of Ford & Lincoln in-vehicle experiences. This includes features that span across the center stack and instrument clusters displays.

As these vehicles are currently in development, I am not permitted to share more. However, I plan to share more details as they go to production.
