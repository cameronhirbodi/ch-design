##### My Role

Visual Design, Icon Design, Animation, Prototyping

##### Objective

This exercise is intended to test various user interactions with instrument clusters using an interactive prototype model. The animations and interactions were created by me using Adobe XD.

<div class="lightgallery">
  <a href="/images/portfolio/instr_clust/instr_clust_lofi.jpg"><img src="/images/portfolio/instr_clust/instr_clust_lofi.jpg" alt="Instrument Cluster - Sketch"></a>
</div>

<div class="lightgallery">
  <a href="/images/portfolio/instr_clust/instr_clust_wire.jpg"><img src="/images/portfolio/instr_clust/instr_clust_wire.jpg" alt="Instrument Cluster - Wireframe"></a>
</div>

The first step was to conceptualize the layout for how the user will simulate basic in-car controls. Once a rough sketch was settled on, the next task was to convert this to a digital outline using Adobe Illustrator.

  <a href="/images/portfolio/instr_clust/instr_clust_hifi.jpg"><img src="/images/portfolio/instr_clust/instr_clust_hifi.jpg" alt="Instrument Cluster - High-Fidelity Mockups"></a>
</div>

From there, I began creating the full color, high-fidelity mockups. Lastly, numerous screens were made to account for each animation and state of the process in Adobe XD.

</div>

The next steps will be updating the prototype to be less of a linear demo. Instead, the user should be able to interact with it freely to be akin to a real driving scenario. This will also make it easier to do usability testing.
